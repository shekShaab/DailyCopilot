# DailyCopilot

DailyCopilot is a task management application designed to help users organize their daily tasks and leverage AI-powered assistance to complete them. It features a dashboard for task management and a library to browse and manage AI-generated content.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with React)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Data Storage:** Client-side `localStorage`

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

-   `app/`: Contains the main pages of the application.
    -   `dailyTask/`: The main dashboard for managing daily tasks.
    -   `OutputLibrary/`: A library to view all AI-generated outputs.
    -   `ContentGenerator/`, `HashtagOptimizer/`, `captionwriter/`: These are the pages for the different AI agents.
-   `Components/`: Contains the React components used throughout the application.
    -   `ui/`: Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui, such as buttons, cards, and dialogs.
    -   `tasks/`: Components specifically related to task management.
-   `lib/`: Contains utility functions.
-   `public/`: Contains static assets like images and icons.

## Core Features

### Task Management

-   **Add and Organize Tasks:** Users can add their daily tasks in the `dailyTask` page.
-   **AI Agent Suggestions:** For each task, the application suggests a suitable AI agent to help with completion (e.g., `Content Generator`, `Hashtag Optimizer`).
-   **Task Status:** Users can track the status of their tasks (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).

### Output Library

-   **Browse Generated Content:** The `OutputLibrary` page displays all the content generated by the AI agents.
-   **Filtering and Searching:** Users can filter outputs by date, agent, type, and usage, as well as search for specific content.
-   **Manage Outputs:** Users can perform actions on the outputs, such as copying, exporting, and sharing.

## Data Flow

The application currently uses the browser's `localStorage` for data persistence.

-   `tasks`: An array of task objects is stored under this key.
-   `taskOutputs`: An array of AI-generated output objects is stored under this key.

There is no backend or database connected. All data is stored and managed on the client-side.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Open the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start by adding some tasks on the "Daily Task Helper" page. The application will suggest AI agents for your tasks, and you can then navigate to the "Output Library" to see the generated content.
